### Research Topic
**Investigating the Relationship between Smoking Dependence and the Amount of Nicotine**

### Research Background

Nicotine is the primary addictive agent that sustains cigarette
smoking, which is responsible for most tobacco-related diseases and premature death
[2]. In terms of helping current tobacco users to quit smoking, researchers suggested
that reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes would achieve the purpose. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collaborated with several other health
organizations have ordered 3.5 million SPECTRUM-brand variable nicotine research
cigarettes from the 22nd Century Group. The SPECTRUM product line consists of
cigarettes that have a fixed “tar” yield, yet their nicotine yields have different levels.
For example, it can go over a 50-fold range, from very low to high. For research
purposes, SPECTRUM cigarettes usually have 24 styles, 11 regular and 13 menthol
versions, with 8 different levels of nicotine content [5]. Thus, FDA believes that using
SPECTRUM cigarettes which have various levels of nicotine but similar
characteristics can help them validate that it is beneficial for the public to have
cigarettes containing minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine.
